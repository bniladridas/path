after years of building ai products that felt hollow, we realized something profound was missing. every recommendation algorithm, every "personalized" feed, every "smart" suggestion was designed to keep you scrolling, clicking, consuming - but never truly satisfied.

<table class="info-table">
<tr>
<th>the problem</th>
<th>what we discovered</th>
</tr>
 <tr>
 <td>algorithmic manipulation</td>
 <td>platforms optimize for engagement, not genuine satisfaction</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>endless scrolling</td>
 <td>people spend hours searching but never find what truly resonates</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>surface-level recommendations</td>
 <td>ai suggests based on data patterns, not human longing</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>digital homelessness</td>
 <td>people feel lost in infinite content, unable to find their way home</td>
 </tr>
</table>

harper emerged from a simple question: what if ai could help you find media that actually matters to your soul?

we stripped away everything designed to manipulate. no engagement metrics. no algorithmic feeds. no data harvesting. just honest conversations about media that might help you discover pieces of yourself.

the name "harper" isn't about the journey - it's about finding your way back home to who you really are through the stories, songs, and experiences that speak to your deepest self.

every feature in harper exists to honor human dignity. the clean interface removes distractions. the transparency tools show you exactly how everything works. the privacy protection ensures your conversations remain yours alone.

this isn't just another ai tool. it's a quiet rebellion against the attention economy - a space where technology serves human flourishing instead of corporate metrics.

come home before it's too late. not to a place, but to yourself.
