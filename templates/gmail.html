    <div class="hero-title-style">gmail integration for harper users:

<table class="info-table">
<tr>
<th>feature</th>
<th>benefit</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>auto verification</td>
<td>all gmail addresses automatically bypass human verification. we trust google's authentication.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>priority access</td>
<td>gmail users get faster response times and enhanced features during peak usage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>privacy protection</td>
<td>your gmail address is never stored or shared. we only verify the domain for access.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>seamless experience</td>
<td>no additional sign-ups or accounts needed. just use your existing gmail identity.</td>
</tr>
</table>

why gmail? because google's security infrastructure is already protecting your identity. we don't need to reinvent authentication when gmail users already have world-class protection.

to enable: simply access harper from an email link or enter your gmail address when prompted. the system automatically recognizes and accepts all @gmail.com addresses.</div>
