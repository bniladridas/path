    <div class="hero-title-style">honest truth about what powers harper:

we use google's gemini 2.5 flash - their latest fast model with 1 million token input context and 8K output, featuring advanced reasoning and multimodal capabilities.

<table class="info-table">
<tr>
<th>pricing</th>
<th>rate (per 1m tokens)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>input tokens</td>
<td>$0.075</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>output tokens</td>
<td>$0.30</td>
</tr>
</table>

reality check: your typical question uses 100-500 input tokens ($0.0000075-0.0000375) and 200-1000 output tokens ($0.00006-0.0003). total under $0.0004 per query.

why we chose this: thoughtful responses without bloated premium model costs. we prioritize your access over profit margins.

privacy: google doesn't use your conversations to improve their products on paid tier. your embarrassing rom-com searches stay private.

this transparency matters because you deserve to know what's behind the curtain.</div>
