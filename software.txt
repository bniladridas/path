SOFTWARE AS SACRED SPACE

Building harper taught me that software isn't just code - it's where humans come to find themselves. Every line either helps someone come home or pushes them away.

WHAT SOFTWARE SHOULD BE

1. HONEST TECHNOLOGY
Tell the truth about what you do. No manipulation, just honest tools for real needs.

2. TIME AS SACRED
Every second in your software is part of someone's life. Don't waste it.

3. HUMAN LONGING
Behind every interaction is a person with hopes and dreams. Honor that.

FOUR PILLARS

1. AUTHENTIC DISCOVERY - No manipulation, honest responses
2. HUMAN LONGING - Emotional intelligence and cultural respect
3. TIME IS PRECIOUS - Minimal interfaces that get out of the way
4. COMING HOME - Familiar patterns that feel safe and welcoming

THE FUTURE

Software that serves genuine needs, not manufactured desires. Technology that helps people find their way home to themselves.
